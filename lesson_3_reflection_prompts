When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Have other people contribute to my work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be new changes you make that you do not want in the remote repository or might be somethign experimental.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - copying a repositroy on GitHub
clones - copying a repository form either a local or remote place to a local place
branch - different version on the same repository
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
if you arent connected to the internet you still have a copy 
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would either send the file via email or USB, but it would be harder to find the differences
